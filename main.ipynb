To simplify this fairly complicated problem, as an intitial step, the node-to-node demand will be calculated down to arc demands via repeatetly solving a shortest path problem. This means, that with the assumption that for every node to node demand taking the shortest path between the two will be most efficient, a demmand connecting Node A and Node B will be added to all arcs that are components of the shortest path connecting both node A and B. Doing so will simplify the problem of fullfilling all node to node demands to fullfilling all arc demands. "

Lines are in this context defined as routes that space trains move along as a single journey, with an equal number of trains going both ways on each line for so to speak flow continiuity across the system (e.g. if 7 trains go on line A to B, the same amount of trains goes on the same line B to A).

    "\n",
    "The attempted linear modeling of the optimal transportation network problem via linear models, shows the limitations of linear models, specifically when it comes to interaction between multiple contributing factors. Each of the seperating steps into simpler problems has an inherent reduction in efficency as interactions between the variables of these sub-problems can no longer be used to find a global optimum. Assuming that all node to node demands take the most direct path reduces the solution space to these shortest paths while it might be more cost effective to increase capacity utilization of lines/trains instead of fulfilling demands via the shortest path. More complicated still is to seperate the interaction between line routing and trains running along them, as the interaction between the different lines and their respective number of trains (many lines and less trains per line vs few lines and many trains per line) is very much intertwined. In this case, there might be the possebility to further investigate linearization practices that might be able to allow modeling these two together as a linear problem as train routing is a binary optimization problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore the aspect of time has been nearly completely been ignored in the modeling done in this thesis, which for is a simplification that could not be made for time critical goods like passangers. \n",
