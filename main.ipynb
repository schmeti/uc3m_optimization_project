To simplify this fairly complicated problem, as an intitial step, the node-to-node demand will be calculated down to arc demands via repeatetly solving a shortest path problem. This means, that with the assumption that for every node to node demand taking the shortest path between the two will be most efficient, a demmand connecting Node A and Node B will be added to all arcs that are components of the shortest path connecting both node A and B. Doing so will simplify the problem of fullfilling all node to node demands to fullfilling all arc demands. "
